## Design

As per the given instructions, the suggested assignment was a static wesite so i went with minimal and classy design with two variant of colors(shades of black and white) and few illustrations.

## Development

As it was a static website i opted into using astro which is known for its performance and features it provides for building static sites.

## Process

- Gone through many designs to keep it simple and minimalistic.
- Started building the site by going through Astro Documentation.
- Learned about Astro,It can import and export components for resualibility but the component must end with (.astro).To make a website fast Astro ships no javascipt,which made it tough to implement few operations but you can use astro islands to use javascipt for a certain component.
- Made the website responsive to most screen sizes.
- Deployed the website in github as per the instructions in thier Documentation.

## Performance

Got 100% on performance,accessability,best practices and SEO in Google Lighthhouse.

## Problems and Solutions

- New framework that i never used. Made me learn many new thing.
- As the framework is no javascipt had to link all the navigation bar link individually.
- Linking images - had to import images as i saw the src link wasnt working.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
